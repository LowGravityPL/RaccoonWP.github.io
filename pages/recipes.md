### How to disable plugin on certain environment
If you need to disable particular plugin on given environment (for example cache plugin when developing locally)
then all you need to do is:
1. Locate the environment config you want to adjust in the `/RaccoonWP/configuration/` directory.
1. Edit and add following snippet to the file:

### How to remove support for Twig templates
In case you are not a fan of TWIG templating you should remove Timber plugin from your project.

Run following command in the root of your project:

### How to add support for Laravel Blade templates
There are many ways to add a support for Laravel Blade templates.
In our opinion the easiest way to do so is to add [Bladerunner plugin](https://github.com/ekandreas/bladerunner) which will handle it for you.

Run following command in the root of your project:
```
composer require ekandreas/bladerunner
``` 

Afterwards navigate to the theme directory and proceed with removal of `Timber::render` function calls as well as all `[filename].twig` templates.

#### How to remove Extended CPTs
