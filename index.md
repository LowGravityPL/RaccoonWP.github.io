# RaccoonWP
**This is 1.0.0-RC1 release, RC coming soon. If you find any issues let us know**

Raccoon is a modern architecture stack and a starter theme for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). 

The stack is based on the Composer on the backend. Node.js with Webpack are used on the frontend. 
This composition allows for a quick and efficient development using the tools which are **state of the art in 2018.**  

You should use it as your boilerplate/starter kit to obtain **optimal architecture with performance, extensibility and security** in mind.

Raccoon is best suited for fresh projects (but there is no problem in implementing it into existing ones with some effort).
